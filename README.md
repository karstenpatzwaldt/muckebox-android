muckebox-android
================

This is an Android application that streams your music from your own server. It uses https://github.com/karstenpatzwaldt/muckebox as its backend, so if you want to try it, get a checkout of the backend and run it on your music library.

Installation
============

There is no compiled binary yet, so if you really want to use this, just import it to Eclipse that comes with the SDK and everything works automagically.
